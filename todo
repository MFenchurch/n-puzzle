big stuff:
- write puzzle_parser (Tanguy)
- write solve (Teo)
- write manhattan

not so big stuff:
- add other heuristic functions

small things
- put possible heuristics in main file help
- add other heuristics to parse_heuristics (main.c)
- check to see if auteur file is spelled correctly
- do we have a better name for data (the t_ushort*)?

map end cases
- multiple lines of comments throughout
- comments with spaces before them at the end of the line
- no \n at the end
- missing a line of data
- missing a column of data
- size is different from that stated at beginning
- line is broken into two lines (thing that broke your count_islands)

thoughts
- if we can't handle up to 16 by 16, change t_ushort to t_ubyte

talk about soon
- manhattan file (when we'd have to call it)
